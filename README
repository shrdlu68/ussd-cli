Silly little hack I use to run USSD sessions (AT+CUSD) in the command-line.
Assumes the modem device file is /dev/ttyUSB0
Works like a REPL, command replies are printed and your input is sent verbatim
May be modified to run arbitrary AT commands.
Usage:
	ussd <code>

For example
	ussd *544#

Enter \q to end the session.
